# Go Journey

Welcome to my Go programming learning journey! This repository contains my progress as I learn Go (Golang) from the ground up.

## 📚 Learning Progress

### Chapter 1: Getting Started

- [x] Hello World program (`src/golang-book/main.go`)
- [x] Basic Go syntax and structure
- [x] Understanding packages and imports

### Chapter 2: Fundamentals

- [ ] Variables and data types
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Control structures

## 🚀 How to Run

Navigate to the specific chapter directory and run:

```bash
cd src/golang-book/
go run main.go
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
