Scope refers to where a variable is accessible in your code. In Go, a variable's scope is determined by where it is declared:
- If declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function (local scope).
- If declared outside any function, it is accessible throughout the package (package scope).
- Variables starting with an uppercase letter are exported and accessible from other packages (exported scope).
